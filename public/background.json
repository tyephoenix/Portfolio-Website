    "description": "I love bringing ideas to life.\n\nI've always been wired to explore, tinker, and solve problems. Whether it's sketching out a new system, shadowing in a pediatric wing, or chasing down a question that won't leave my head—I dive in because I genuinely enjoy the process. The confusion, the breakthroughs, the chaos before clarity—it's all part of the game.\n\nI've had to be persistent in my life, and that shows up in my work. I build because I can't not. There's always something I want to try next."
