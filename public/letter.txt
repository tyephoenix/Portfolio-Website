I am writing to express interest in $POSITION$ at $COMPANY$. As a student pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, I have a developed foundation for my technical skills and entrepreneurial spirit. I am applying with a GPA of $GPA$, and diverse experiences. I look forward to contributing to your team and developing my skills in a real-world setting.

During my time at MIT, I have participated in academic and extracurricular activities that have enriched my academic experience. I have completed academic work in a variety of disciplines, enjoyed my education at MIT, and showcased a thirst for knowledge. Beyond my academic achievements, I have developed several mobile applications specifically addressing healthcare challenges, demonstrating my ability to translate my skills in technology to real-world impact. One of my current projects is a healthcare concept based thread-based mobile application, which I’m developing as part of my startup. This program not only honed my technical skills but also allowed me to explore the complexities of business, including securing funding through MIT’s resources.

This led me to join MIT’s premier entrepreneur club, StartLabs, which further fueled my passion for innovation. Through this group, I expanded my learning beyond the technical aspects to valuable lessons about product development, market research and teamwork. These experiences have taught me the skills necessary to succeed in a dynamic work environment, where creativity and collaboration are essential.

In addition to my academic and professional activities, I am also a dedicated member of the MIT varsity baseball team. This experience taught me the importance of discipline, teamwork and perseverance. Balancing sport with my studies has strengthened my ability to manage time effectively and focus in tense situations.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences can contribute to $COMPANY$. I am eager to bring my enthusiasm for technology and innovation to your team and help drive meaningful projects forward.
