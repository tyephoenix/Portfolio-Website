I am writing to express my interest in $POSITION$ at $COMPANY$. As a Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence student at MIT (GPA: $GPA$/5.0), I’ve spent the past few years building systems that connect people, data, and behavior. I love working at the edge of what’s possible, where a question becomes a prototype, and an idea becomes something people actually use.

Much of my work explores how technology can mirror, learn from, and influence human systems. I built Ant, a social simulation platform where thousands of AI agents debate, vote, and model human behavior at scale; Parrot, a small language model that powers those agents with persona-level realism; and Marmot, a data pipeline that continuously transforms unstructured web data into living, validated datasets. What began as curiosity projects in my dorm room grew into tools used by thousands, raising over $500K in funding and sparking collaborations across AI, social science, and product design.

Through these builds, I’ve learned to balance creative exploration with engineering discipline, to design for both clarity and chaos. Whether it’s architecting distributed systems, iterating model behavior, or running late-night debugging sessions, I’ve learned that building is about persistence as much as it is about vision.

At MIT, I’m also part of StartLabs, the university’s premier entrepreneurship group, where I’ve worked on translating deep technical work into viable products—learning how to go from idea to insight to impact. That mindset shows up everywhere I work: in code, design, and leadership. Outside of tech, I play varsity baseball, where teamwork and precision are as important as they are in engineering.

I’m drawn to $COMPANY$ because it feels like a place where curiosity leads to real impact—where engineers are encouraged to think deeply, experiment boldly, and build things that genuinely change how people interact, learn, and decide. I’d love to bring my technical depth, maker’s mindset, and passion for human-centered design to your team.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
