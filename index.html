        <h2>Braatz Group at MIT</h2>
        <h3>Computational Researcher for Chemical Engineering</h2>
        <p>The Braatz Group is a section in the Ford Chemical Engineering building on MIT's campus that focuses on computational and theoretical aspects of chemical engineering. They work primarily alongside the Myerson labratory to formulate models of chemical reactions and monticlonal antibody processes with the use of control theory.</p>
        <p>I formulated many simulations of bilinear chemical reactions, two-tank systems, and monticlonal antibody purification. The purpose of these simulations is to stabilize stochastic processes and optimize paramaters to model these processes for application. By having these models, scientists are able to better understand the relationships in their mechanisms and optimize their processes. My goal on the project was to use control theory to model these types of chemical equations in Julia and determine that parameters neccessary.</p>

        <h2>Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research</h2>
        <h3>Leukemia and Lung Cancer Researcher</h2>
        <p>I performed many experiments on Ba/F3 IL-3 dependent cancer cells. The premise of this experiment was to cultivate different cell lines along with the wild-type under an arbitrary time period to see how the cells responded to presence and absence of IL-3. I completed this experiment myself through many trials and saw that the 'EA' genetic knockout cell line grew without IL-3, suggesting the 'EA' knockout to be a cancerous gene.</p>
        <p>Another experiment I did revolved around rapamycin, a substrate involved in binding both fragments of the Cas9 CRISPR protein domain. I conducted an experiment to find the dose curve of rapamycin, by presenting the multiple wells of B-ALL cells with both domains of Cas9 and enforcing conditions of different rapamycin amounts. By using flow cytometry, I was able to formulate a dose curve for rapamycin.</p>
